# Matrix dissimilarity from the differences of Moments and sparsity

I am introducing this work in YouTube, if you are interested, please visit: https://www.youtube.com/@Iobiomathematics. These works have been publically deposited in this Github since one year ago (I hidden some previous versions after updated new versions). Also, it has been deposited in Zenodo. Tuobang Li. (2023). Matrix dissimilarities based on differences in moments and sparsity. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10406288
